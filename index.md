Welcome to experimental probability and simulation. In this course we will conduct experiments and draw insights from them. This course will large be 'food based' meaning wherever possible we will be testing claims involving food. Some examples are:

* Can you taste the rainbow? Testing whether or not an individual can identify the color of a skittle correctly. 
* Are double stuffed oreos truely double stuffed? Testing claims that companies make about there products.
